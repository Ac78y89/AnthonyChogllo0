        <h1><u>Political/Economic Measures</u></h1>
        <h4>It is crucial for political and economic measures to be taken to address this issue, as it is not only a matter of social justice but also necessary for building a more inclusive society.</h4>

        <div class="one">
          <h4>New York</h4>

          <p>To boost economic growth and create more job opportunities for women, the government can offer financing, training, and mentorship programs for women-owned businesses, along with specialized funds and grants. These economic measures can foster a diverse and inclusive business landscape in New York.</p>

        <div class="two">
          <h4>Palestine</h4>
          <img src="resources/img12.png" alt="alt" width="600" height="250"/>
          <p>A World Bank report released in September 2020 indicated that the unemployment rate  among  women in Palestine rose to approximately 38%, a figure that far  exceeds the unemployment rate among men, which reached about 23% during the same period.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="three">
          <h4>Palestine</h4>
          <img src="resources/img13.jpg" alt="alt" width="600" height="250"/>
          <p>Data from the Palestinian Bureau of Economic Analysis indicates that the unemployment rate  among women in Palestine is about 42.6%, which is much higher than the unemployment rate among men which is about 18.9%. This rate is increasing in urban sectors and in Gaza in particular, where unemployment rates for women are high.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four">
          <h4>New York</h4>
          <img src="resources/img14.avif" alt="alt" width="600" height="250"/>
          <p>The government can promote political measures to increase representation of women in leadership positions by implementing policies that encourage diversity and inclusivity in the workplace, including affirmative action programs. Such measures can help address systemic barriers that prevent women from advancing in their careers and create a more diverse and inclusive workforce.</p>
